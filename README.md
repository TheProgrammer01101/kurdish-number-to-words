# kurdish-number-to-words
This software converts numbers to words and reads it with my own voice in Kurdish.
For example if you input 999999999999999 it converts it to "Nine hundred ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine" as the result.
